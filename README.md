Overwiew of the Project 

Project: Create database library and write queries to insert , update , delete and retrieve data.

Objective:                                                                                                                                                                                
 The Objective of this project is to perform given queries that is data inserting , updating and deleting using proper syntax . The Aim is to maintain a comprehensive database of Library Management System will include table that store and organize information about books , users/students and transaction.  
 
Queries:                                                                                                                                                                                    
 - Insert :  This Query writes new rows of data into a table.                                                                                                                            
 - Update : This Query changes the data of one or more records in a table .                                                                                                                 
 - Delete :This query used to delete existing records from a table.                                                                                                                            
 - Retrieve Data : This query is used to specify the columns you want to retrieve from the database.

Technologies Used : 
- My Structured Query Language (MYSQL)

  
Detailed Information : 

 In this task, we will follow a structured process to create and manage a library database.                                                                                                
 The steps include:

Create the Database:                                                                                                                                                                     
 We will begin by creating a database named library and then select it for use.

Create the Members Table:                                                                                                                                                             
 Next, we will create a table called members to store information about library members including their id , names , emails and phone numbers.
 We will then insert several records into this table and display the information.

Create the Books Table:                                                                                                                                                           
 Following that, we will create a table named books to keep track of the books available in the library, including titles, authors and available copies.
 Again, we will insert data into this table and display the records.

Create the Borrowings Table:                                                                                                                                                               
 We will then establish a borrowings table to record which members have borrowed which books, along with the dates of borrowing and returning.
 We will insert relevant data and show the entries.

Perform Update and Delete Operations:                                                                                                                                              
 Finally, we will demonstrate how to update existing records (such as member details or book availability) and delete records when necessary.
